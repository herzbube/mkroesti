"""
mkroesti is a hash generator written in Python.

mkroesti can be used both as a command line utility and as a web tool. It takes
an input (e.g. a file, or a password) and generates different kinds of hashes
from that input. The hashes to generate are selected by naming them on the
command line, or ticking the corresponding checkboxes in the web GUI.

mkroesti provides no hash algorithm implementations of its own. Instead it
consists of a collection of front-ends to hash algorithms available in the
Python Standard Library, and from a number of third-party modules. The README
file gives details about the dependencies of mkroesti.

mkroesti also defines a couple of interfaces that allow third parties to inject
new front-ends to previously unavailable hash algorithms. The README file has
more information on how this extension mechanism works.
