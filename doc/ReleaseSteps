Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document lists the steps needed to make a project release.


Before the release
------------------
- if necessary, update the TODO file
- update the ChangeLog file (should have been done continuously, anyway)
- replace the "Changes in this release" section in the README file with a
  collection of the most important entries from the ChangeLog file and/or the
  git log
- change the release date in the following files:
  - MANUAL
  - Roadmap
- make sure that the version number is up to date in the following files
  (it should have been bumped already after the last release was made):
  - README
  - MANUAL
  - setup.py
  - mkroesti/__init__.py
- make sure that the copyright year is up to date in the following files:
  - *.py
- add the new version number to the bug tracker so that issues can be reported
  once the release has been made public
- run automated tests, both for Python 2.6 and Python 3, either in the IDE or
  on the command line, by issuing the following commands:
    cd <projectdir>
    ./setup.py test
- make the source distribution tar ball by issuing the following commands (check
  the command's output for suspicious warnings, although you can ignore warnings
  about missing README, .DS_Store and *.pyc files):
    cd <projectdir>
    ./setup.py sdist
- take the source distribution tar ball to another system, install it on that
  system and try to run mkroesti:
    cd ~
    tar xfvz mkroesti-x.y.tar.gz
    cd mkroesti-x.y
    ./setup.py test
    ./setup.py install --home=~
    PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python ~/bin/mkroesti -ba all foo
- commit final changes (check with "git status" that nothing was forgotten)


Make the release
----------------
- tag and sign the release
  cd <projectdir>
  git tag -s -m "tagging release x.y" x.y <commit hash>
- update the blessed repository
  cd <projectdir>
  git push
- make source distribution tar ball available on the project website
- update the website to announce the new release


After the release
-----------------
- cleanup
  cd <projectdir>
  rm MANIFEST
  rm -r dist
- bump the version number to the next planned release; check above under
  "Before the release" which files are affected
