  third party module aprmd5

  (relying on the Exception class defining __str__()) instead of accessing the
  object's internal attributes

- added --codec command line option
- the --version command line option now prints out the default encoding for
  diagnostic purposes
- tests/test_main.py: now uses __name__ attribute to reference the module
  (instead of a hardcoded module name)

Tue Mar 24 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- changes for compatibility with Python 3
  - change all relative import statements to be absolute; this is due to the
    new relative import syntax "from .foo import bar" (see PEP 328); making all
    imports absolute is the easiest way to remain compatible with older versions
    of Python (it also makes PyDev happy, which does not know yet about the new
    relative import syntax); affected files: pretty much all files: 
  - use "except exc as var" instead of "except exc, var" (see PEP 3110);
    according to the PEP, this syntax has been backported to Python 2.6;
    affected files: mkroesti/main.py, tests.test_main.py
  - change print statement to print() function; to make this work in Python 2.6
    also, I use "from __future__ import print_function"; affected files:
    scripts/mkroesti, mkroesti/main.py, tests/test_main.py
  - change handling of dict.keys() where necessary; this is due to the function
    now returning a "view" instead of a list object; where a change is
    necessary, a list object is now created explicitly (e.g. using
    "list(dict.keys())" or "sorted(dict.keys())"); where sorting of normally
    unsortable objects takes place (e.g. provider intances), the object's id()
    is used as the sort key; these changes are compatible with older versions
    of Python; affected files: mkroesti/provider.py, mkroesti/registry.py,
    tests/test_factory.py, tests/test_provider.py, tests/test_registry.py
  - replace built-in function callable(), which has been removed from Python 3,
    by the suggested form "hasattr(f, '__call__')"; this change is compatible
    with older versions of Python; affected files: mkroesti/main.py
  - fix input handling to match the new "text vs. data" paradigm of Python 3;
    use the new type "bytes" where appropriate, and explicitly open files in
    binary mode; affected files: mkroesti/main.py, tests/test_main.py
- renamed "input" variable in main.py because the built-in input() function was
  accidentally shadowed
- fixed comments about provider instantiation and registration in DESIGN

Mon Mar 23 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- version 0.1

Sun Mar 22 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added --providers and --exclude-builtins command line options
- AbstractProvider no longer registers itself automatically; the automatic part
  is now done in main.py when mkroesti is run from the command line; for other
  hacking purposes (e.g. unit tests) there are now convenience functions in
  mkroesti.__init__.py
- AbstractProvider now provides a useful implementation for getAliasNames()
- added document TESTING

Sat Mar 21 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- organizational changes
  - switched project source control from Subversion to git
  - removed Subversion keyword substitution line
  - updated copyright notice to 2009

    to the source distribution, though (via MANIFEST.in), so that tests can be
    run on a target machine
- documentation overhaul
  - updated ReleaseSteps document
  - added the documents Roadmap, Research and INSTALL
  - rewrote parts of README, also added section titled "How to extend mkroesti"
  - improved algorithm/alias descriptions in MANUAL

    "encoding" (previously under "chksum")
