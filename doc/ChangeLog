Tue Mar 31 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added extension module mkroesti.aprutil
  - module contains prototype implementations that wrap apr_md5() and
    apr_md5_encode()
  - added build support to setup.py
  - added algorithm and provider implementations
  - added crypt-apr1 to exclude list for end-to-end test

Fri Mar 27 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added end-to-end test suite
  - test script in src/scripts/mkroesti-test
  - test data in src/packages/tests/testdata

Thu Mar 26 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- cleanup handling of --codec command line argument
  - documented design decisions about handling of encodings in the DESIGN file
  - clarified ENCODINGS section in MANUAL
  - added various warnings to main function
- documentation fixes due to misunderstanding of locale-based vs. default
  encoding
- added test cases for --codec to tests.test_main.py

Wed Mar 25 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added --codec command line option
- the --version command line option now prints out the default encoding for
  diagnostic purposes
- tests/test_main.py: now uses __name__ attribute to reference the module
  (instead of a hardcoded module name)

Tue Mar 24 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- changes for compatibility with Python 3
  - change all relative import statements to be absolute; this is due to the
    new relative import syntax "from .foo import bar" (see PEP 328); making all
    imports absolute is the easiest way to remain compatible with older versions
    of Python (it also makes PyDev happy, which does not know yet about the new
    relative import syntax); affected files: pretty much all files: 
  - use "except exc as var" instead of "except exc, var" (see PEP 3110);
    according to the PEP, this syntax has been backported to Python 2.6;
    affected files: mkroesti/main.py, tests.test_main.py
  - change print statement to print() function; to make this work in Python 2.6
    also, I use "from __future__ import print_function"; affected files:
    scripts/mkroesti, mkroesti/main.py, tests/test_main.py
  - change handling of dict.keys() where necessary; this is due to the function
    now returning a "view" instead of a list object; where a change is
    necessary, a list object is now created explicitly (e.g. using
    "list(dict.keys())" or "sorted(dict.keys())"); where sorting of normally
    unsortable objects takes place (e.g. provider intances), the object's id()
    is used as the sort key; these changes are compatible with older versions
    of Python; affected files: mkroesti/provider.py, mkroesti/registry.py,
    tests/test_factory.py, tests/test_provider.py, tests/test_registry.py
  - replace built-in function callable(), which has been removed from Python 3,
    by the suggested form "hasattr(f, '__call__')"; this change is compatible
    with older versions of Python; affected files: mkroesti/main.py
  - fix input handling to match the new "text vs. data" paradigm of Python 3;
    use the new type "bytes" where appropriate, and explicitly open files in
    binary mode; affected files: mkroesti/main.py, tests/test_main.py
- renamed "input" variable in main.py because the built-in input() function was
  accidentally shadowed
- fixed comments about provider instantiation and registration in DESIGN

Mon Mar 23 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- version 0.1

Sun Mar 22 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added --providers and --exclude-builtins command line options
- AbstractProvider no longer registers itself automatically; the automatic part
  is now done in main.py when mkroesti is run from the command line; for other
  hacking purposes (e.g. unit tests) there are now convenience functions in
  mkroesti.__init__.py
- AbstractProvider now provides a useful implementation for getAliasNames()
- added document TESTING

Sat Mar 21 2009   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- organizational changes
  - switched project source control from Subversion to git
  - removed Subversion keyword substitution line
  - updated copyright notice to 2009
  - setup.py no longer installs the "tests" package; the package is still added
    to the source distribution, though (via MANIFEST.in), so that tests can be
    run on a target machine
- documentation overhaul
  - updated ReleaseSteps document
  - added the documents Roadmap, Research and INSTALL
  - rewrote parts of README, also added section titled "How to extend mkroesti"
  - improved algorithm/alias descriptions in MANUAL
- implementation changes
  - base16, base32 and base64 algorithms are now grouped under the alias
    "encoding" (previously under "chksum")
  - fixed name collision between "ripemd" algorithm and "ripemd" alias (algorithm
    is now named "ripemd-original")

Mon Dec 08 2008   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- marked up the MANUAL file using reStructured text
- wrote section "How to generate documentation" in README

Mon Dec 01 2008   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- rewrote README and TODO documents
- added DESIGN document

Sun Nov 30 2008   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- added COPYING (full text of GPLv3)
- added copyright notice at the top of each source file
