Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document gives a broad view of the plan for future development of the
project. There is no time schedule associated with releases. It happens when it
happens :-)

In addition to this roadmap document, there is a TODO list that contains minor
features and technical stuff, ideas for which come up on-the-fly. If something
on the TODO list becomes important, it is possible to move it from there to
this roadmap.
