Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains a list of minor features and technical stuff that should
be implemented when time permits it. The TODO list is updated frequently as new
ideas crop up during programming.

For a broader view of how the project will develop over time, you should see
the Roadmap document.


Priority 1 (important)
----------------------
- publish initial releases
- fix TODOs in the code

module = __import__('.'.join(parts_copy))
elif callable(obj):


Priority 2 (nice to have)
-------------------------
- try to improve handling of large inputs
- find out why adler32 and crc32 checksums (provided by zlib module) are not correct
  - adler32 for "foo": expected = 45018202 (hex, i.e. dec = 1157726722), actual = 42074437 (dec)
  - crc32 for "foo": expected = A5C4FE49 (hex, i.e. dec = 2781150793), actual = -1938594527 (dec)
  - see issue 1202: http://bugs.python.org/issue1202
    - as per standard, the result should always be an unsigned number
    - python 2.x implementation always returns a signed number


Priority 3 (not important)
-------------------------
- add more tests
  - write a testcase class that accepts a provider in its __init__ and then goes on to exercise the provider to make sure that its implementation is valid
    -> subclass the testcase and exercise the various concrete providers
  - test deep copying? e.g. provider.getAliasNames() should return a list that we can modify, but the next call should return the same list
  - write a test that uses AlgorithmStub and ProviderStub to exercise some functionality; see helper setUpProviderStub()
- register with PyPI
- check whether in Python 3 the command "python setup.py test --help" still
  prints out the command class' name instead of the command name string used
  to setup the command; file a bug with Distutils if this problem still persists
