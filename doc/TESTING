Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains information about the project's testing facilities.

In a nutshell, the following facilities exist:
- automated unit test suite using Python's unittest module; this test suite can
  be run on the command line or from within the Eclipse IDE
- automated end-to-end test suite that can be run on the command line
- manual tests by running mkroesti on the command line


Run unit tests from the command line
------------------------------------
The following command runs all automated tests from the command line, from
within the git working tree:

  ./setup.py test

To run tests from only one module (test.algorithm.py in this example):

  setup.py test --suite=tests.test_algorithm


Run unit tests from within Eclipse
----------------------------------
There are two types of run configuration that can be used to run mkroesti's
automated test suite from within Eclipse:

- the "Python unittest" configuration type, which runs the tests directly from
  the "tests" package
- The "Python Run" configuration type, which is using setup.py to run the tests

Set up a run configuration of type "Python unittest":
- PyDev must be installed for the following to work
- Right-click on the folder that contains your tests and select
  "Run as... -> Python unittest"
- Configure the resulting run configuration as follows:
  - name = mkroesti tests
  - project = mkroesti
  - main module = ${workspace_loc:mkroesti/src/packages/tests} (or any other folder that contains tests)
  - on the "Arguments" tab: working directory = ${workspace_loc:mkroesti/src/packages}

Set up a run configuration of type "Python Run":
- PyDev must be installed for the following to work
- Open "Run configurations" dialog
- Double-click "Python Run" to create a new configuration
- Configure the resulting run configuration as follows:
  - name = mkroesti tests (setup.py)
  - project = mkroesti
  - main module = ${workspace_loc:mkroesti/setup.py}
  - on the "Arguments" tab: program arguments = "test" 


Run end-to-end test suite from the command line
-----------------------------------------------
The end-to-end test suite is a shell script that exercises the mkroesti
front-end. The goals of this test suite are:
- Have a black-box oriented end-to-end test suite (as opposed to the more
  detailed, white-box oriented unit tests)
- Exercises *all* algorithms available in the current environment
- Exercise *all* input methods

To run the test suite from within a git working tree, do the following:

  cd src/scripts
  PYTHONPATH=../packages ./mkroesti-test

Documentation of the test suite:
- command line usage: run the script using --help
- test data: read the file packages/tests/testdata/README


Run mkroesti from the command line
----------------------------------
The mkroesti shell script can be run on the command line to execute a manual
end-to-end test, e.g. to compare the script's output with predefined hashes.

To run mkroesti from within a git working tree, do the following:

  cd src/scripts
  PYTHONPATH=../packages ./mkroesti --batch foo


Writing new unit tests
----------------------
New test modules must be placed into the "tests" package. If the module is
intended to be run by setup.py, it must also be added to the callable

  tests.__init__.py.allTests()

Last but not least, each module should contain the following block of code so
that it can be run standalone:

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      unittest.main()
