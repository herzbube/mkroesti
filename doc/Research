Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains notes about ongoing research.


Research
--------
- The module "m2crypto" (MeTooCrypto) [1]
  - Debian package "python-m2crypto"
  - the module is a wrapper for OpenSSL
  - more investigation is needed
- The module "mcrypt" [2]; manually built package "python-mcrypt"; is a wrapper for the mcrypt library
  - how to get the python module
    - download
    - unpack tar ball
    - install dependencies (python-dev, libmcrypt-dev)
    - ./setup.py build
    - ./setup.py install
  - what does the library/python module provide?
- details about the Apache-specific md5 algorithm can be found here [3]; the page mentions that OpenSSL knows the algorithm, therefore I try to use a python wrapper for OpenSSL to get at the algorithm
