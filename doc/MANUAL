NAME
====

**mkroesti** - generate different kinds of hashes


SYNOPSIS
========

| **mkroesti** [**-e**] [**-a** *LIST*] [**-d**]
| **mkroesti** **-b** [**-a** *LIST*] [**-d**] *input*
| **mkroesti** **-f** *FILE* [**-a** *LIST*] [**-d**]
| **mkroesti** **-l**
| **mkroesti** **-V**
| **mkroesti** **-h**


DESCRIPTION
===========

The **mkroesti** command takes an input and generates different kinds of hashes from that input. Without special instructions, **mkroesti** takes its input either from standard input or asks for it interactively. Unless echo mode is enabled (**--echo**), **mkroesti** does not display input typed by the user, assuming that the user enters a secret password.

Additional sources for the input are: a file (**--file**) or the command line (**--batch**). Note that the latter option should be used with extreme care, since if the input is a password, it will be visible to any programm or user looking at the system's list of processes at the time when **mkroesti** is run.

The user usually specifies one or more algorithms (**--algorithms**) that should be used to generate hashes. If no specific algorithm is selected, **mkroesti** generates hashes for all algorithms that it knows about.

**mkroesti** knows about a number of built-in hash algorithms and aliases. These are listed further down in the **ALGORITHMS** and **ALIASES** section. Using the **--providers** option, it is possible to extend **mkroesti** with new hash algorithms and aliases. Details are listed in the **ALGORITHM PROVIDERS** section.


OPTIONS
=======

-a LIST, --algorithms LIST
  Comma separated list of algorithms and/or aliases that should be used to generate hashes. See **ALGORITHMS** and **ALIASES** below.

-b, --batch
  Use batch mode; i.e., get the input from the command line rather than prompting for it. This option should be used with extreme care, since if the input is a password, it will be visible to any program or user looking at the system's list of processes at the time when **mkroesti** is run.

-d, --duplicate-hashes
  Allow duplicate hashes; i.e. if the same algorithm is available from multiple implementation sources, generate a hash for each implementation.

-e, --echo
  Enable echo mode; i.e. when the user is prompted for input, the characters she types are echoed on the screen. This option cannot be combined with **--batch** or **--file**.

-f FILE, --file FILE
  Read the input from **FILE**.

-l, --list
  List all supported algorithms, together with the information which algorithms are actually available, and which implementation sources exist for them.

-p LIST, --providers LIST
  Comma separated list of third party Python modules that provide hash algorithms. This option can be used to extend mkroesti with new algorithms. See **ALGORITHM PROVIDERS** below.

-x, --exclude-builtin
  Exclude built-in algorithms from the operation of **mkroesti**. This is useful if you want to test your own algorithm providing modules without interference from built-in algorithms.

-V, --version
  Print the version number.

-h, --help
  Show a short usage summary.

ALGORITHM PROVIDERS
===================

It is possible to extend **mkroesti** with new algorithms by specifying third party Python modules that provide these new algorithms. The option to use is **--providers**, the option value is a list of comma separated Python modules that provide the new algorithms. The following example adds algorithms provided by the three new modules *mymodule1*, *mymodule2* and *mypackage.mymodule3* to whatever operation is performed by **mkroesti**:

  **mkroesti** **--providers** *mymodule1*,*mymodule2,*mypackage.mymodule3* [...]

The specified modules must be available for importing via the regular Python module search path. If the modules are not part of the system, it might be necessary to make them known to Python by setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Every module must contain a callable named "getProviders"; this will usually be a function. **mkroesti** invokes the callable and expects to get a list of instances of algorithm provider classes in return. **mkroesti** registers these provider instances in its internal system, just as it does for its own built-in providers. **mkroesti** then goes on to perform whatever operation was requested.

For the gritty details, use **pydoc** to view the API documentation inside the modules **mkroesti.algorithm** and **mkroesti.provider**. It might also be useful to have a look at an example, a good one would be **mkroesti.algorithm.Base64Algorithms** and **mkroesti.provider.Base64Provider**.


EXAMPLES
========

(1) Prompt the user to interactively provide the input, not echoing the input on the screen. Hashes for all algorithms are generated.

  **mkroesti** 


(2) Take the input from file *foo* and generate hashes for the algorithms **md5**, **sha-1** and **haval-128** (4 rounds variant).

  **mkroesti** **-f** *foo* **-a** **md5**,**sha-1**,**haval-128-4**


(3) Take the input from standard input and generate a single hash using the local crypt() system function.

  **cat** foo | **mkroesti** **-a** **crypt-system**


(4) Use the string *secret* as input and generate hashes for all algorithms of the SHA and RIPEMD family.

  **mkroesti** **-b** **-a** **sha**,**ripemd** *secret*


(5) List all supported algorithms, which in this case are: built-in algorithms, and algorithms provided by the Python module *mymodule*.

  **mkroesti** **-l** **-p** *mymodule*


(6) Use the string *secret* as input and generate a single hash using the algorithm *myalgorithm*. Algorithms provided by the Python module *mymodule* are included in the operation (which is probably what the user wants, since *myalgorithm* is not a built-in algorithm).

  **mkroesti** **-b** **-p** *mymodule* **-a** *myalgorithm* *secret*


(7) Use the string *secret* as input and generate hashes for all algorithms provided by the Python module *mymodule*.

  **mkroesti** **-b** **-x** **-p** *mymodule* *secret*


EXIT CODES
==========

| 0  success
| 1  runtime error
| 2  error during parsing of command line arguments


BUGS
====

**mkroesti** is not good at handling large files, because it tries to read its entire input into memory.

**mkroesti** does nothing at all about string encodings; if in doubt assume the worst.

If you find any other bugs, please report them to <**mkroesti**@herzbube.ch>.
