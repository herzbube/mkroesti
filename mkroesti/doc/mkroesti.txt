Project description
-------------------
* Why mkroesti
  * At first because I thought it might be useful to me, or someone else
  * In time I found utilities that do everything mkroesti is intended to do, and probably better
  * Since there is no real justification left to realize the project, I settled for "this is a learning project"

* Other tools
  * Online hash generators
  * python-smbpasswd
  * libcrypt-smbhash-perl
  * hashalot

* Why "Rösti"?
  * Hash = Hash browns = Rösti
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6sti
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_browns

* Specifications are written in the form of a manual

* Research is kept on a Wiki page

* Learning goals
  * programming in Python
  * using a Python program as CGI script
  * hashes & encodings
  * write documentation in XML and use XSLT to transform it into various formats
    * man page
    * man page / HTML
    * README
    * ...

* Additional hash algorithms
  * python-bcrypt


Design
------
* factory that creates algorithm instances based on the name(s) specified on the cmdline
* how do we handle aliases?
  * option 1: factory resolves aliases to the real algorithm names and creates the necessary instances
    * pro
      * alias to algorithm mapping is kept in one place
      * complexity of algorithm class is low
    * con
      * algorithm names appear in several places
      * factory class complexity is slightly higher
  * option 2: each algorithm knows which aliases it belongs to
    * pro
      * algorithm names are kept in one place
      * factory class complexity is low
    * con
      * alias names appear in several places
      * complexity of algorithm class is higher
      * it might also be necessary to extend the aliasing concept into the registry
   * as long as the aliasing concept does not require more than creating multiple instances, option 1 is better


Specification/Manual
--------------------

NAME
  mkroesti - generate different kinds of hashes

SYNOPSIS
  mkroesti [-e] [-a LIST]
  mkroesti -b [-a LIST] input
  mkroesti -f FILE [-a LIST]
  mkroesti -h

DESCRIPTION
  The mkroesti command takes an input and generates different kinds of hashes from that input. Without special instructions, mkroesti takes its input either from standard input or asks for it interactively. Unless echo mode is enabled (-e), mkroesti does not display input typed by the user, assuming that the user enters a secret password.

  Additional sources for the input are: a file (-f) or the command line (-b). Note that the latter option should be used with extreme care, since if the input is a password, it will be clearly visible on the command line.

  The user may specify one or more algorithms that should be used to generate hashes. If no specific algorithm is selected, mkroesti generates hashes for all algorithms that it knows about.

OPTIONS
  -a LIST, --algorithms LIST
    Comma separated list of algorithms for which to generate hashes. See ALGORITHMS below.

  -b, --batch
     Use batch mode; i.e., get the input from the command line rather than prompting for it. This option should be used with extreme care, since if the input is a password, it will be clearly visible on the command line.

  -e, --echo
     Enable Echo mode; i.e. when the user is prompted for input, the characters she types are echoed on the screen

  -f FILE, --file FILE
     Read the input from FILE

  -h, --help
     Show a short usage summary.       

ALGORITHMS
  mkroesti defines the following keywords to identify distinct hash algorithms:

  base64
  crypt        use local crypt()
  *apr1         apr1 algorithm (Apache variant of the BSD algorithm)
  md2
  md4
  md5
  sha-0        original, superseded by sha-1
  sha-1
  sha-224
  sha-256
  sha-384
  sha-512
  *ripemd       original, superseded by ripemd-160
  *ripemd-128
  ripemd-160
  *ripemd-256
  *ripemd-320
  *haval-128-[345]   3, 4 or 5 rounds
  *haval-160-[345]
  *haval-192-[345]
  *haval-224-[345]
  *haval-256-[345]
  *whirlpool
  *tiger-128
  *tiger-160
  *tiger-192
  *tiger2
  windows-lm
  windows-nt
  *mysql-password       MySQL's PASSWORD() function

  mkroesti defines the following aliases to refer to sets of hash algorithms

  all
  sha
  ripemd
  haval
  tiger

EXAMPLES

  (1) Prompt the user to interactively provide the input, not echoing the input on the screen. Hashes for all algorithms are generated.
  
    mkroesti 

  (2) Take the input from file foo and generate hashes for the algorithms md5, sha-1 and haval-128 (4 rounds variant)
  
    mkroesti -f foo -a md5,sha-1,haval-128-4

  (3) Take the input from standard input and generate a single hash using the local crypt() system function
  
    cat foo | mkroesti -a crypt

  (4) Use the string "secret" as input and generate hashes for all algorithms of the SHA and RIPEMD family.
  
    mkroesti -b -a sha,ripemd secret

EXIT CODES

  0  success
  1  runtime error
  2  error during parsing of command line arguments

BUGS

  mkroesti is not good at handling large files, because it tries to read its entire input into memory.

  If you find any other bugs, please report them to <mkroesti@herzbube.ch>.

DEPENDENCIES

  mkroesti depends on the following Python modules:

    base64
    hashlib
    crypt
    random
    string
    smbpasswd (see http://barryp.org/software/py-smbpasswd/)

Analysis
--------
General program flow:
1) Select algorithm(s)
2) Convert program input into algorithm input
   - determine program input encoding: auto-detect, or by specification of command line arguments
   - normalize program input to UTF-8
3) For each selected algorithm, generate hash
   - prepare algorithm input
     - if algorithm does not require specific encoding and/or transformation of input
       - use the original program input as the algorithm input
     - if algorithm requires specific encoding and/or transformation of input
       - if encoding is required: convert normalized UTF-8 input into encoding required by algorithm
       - if transformation (e.g. conversion to upper case) is required: perform transformation
       - use the encoded and/or transformed input as the algorithm input
  - generate hash
  - convert hash into desired output format
4) Output all results


TODO
----
* implement missing hashes
* a couple of TODOs in the code
* add a command line option to list the supported hashes
* try to improve handling of large inputs
* add base16, base32 encodings (provided by base64 module)
* add adler32 and crc32 checksums (provided by zlib module)
* cf. "man dgst": openssl supports "mdc2" digest; what is this?
* cf. "man dgst": openssl supports "dss1" digest (for signing/verifying using the DSA algorithm), but this also requires "a source of random numbers"
* gracefully handle the situation that an algorithm is not available, e.g. if a python module is not available, or OpenSSL does not provide the digest
* implement handling of encoding, or throw the issue out & add a comment under "BUGS"
* add test suite
