Project description
-------------------
* Why mkroesti
  * At first because I thought it might be useful to me, or someone else
  * In time I found utilities that do everything mkroesti is intended to do, and probably better
  * Since there is no real justification left to realize the project, I settled for "this is a learning project"

* Why "Rösti"?
  * Hash = Hash browns = Rösti

NAME
  mkroesti - generate different kinds of hashes

SYNOPSIS
  mkroesti [-e] [-a LIST] [-d]
  mkroesti -b [-a LIST] [-d] input
  mkroesti -f FILE [-a LIST] [-d]
  mkroesti -l
  mkroesti -h

DESCRIPTION
  The mkroesti command takes an input and generates different kinds of hashes from that input. Without special instructions, mkroesti takes its input either from standard input or asks for it interactively. Unless echo mode is enabled (-e), mkroesti does not display input typed by the user, assuming that the user enters a secret password.

  Additional sources for the input are: a file (-f) or the command line (-b). Note that the latter option should be used with extreme care, since if the input is a password, it will be clearly visible on the command line.

  The user may specify one or more algorithms that should be used to generate hashes. If no specific algorithm is selected, mkroesti generates hashes for all algorithms that it knows about.

OPTIONS
  -a LIST, --algorithms LIST
    Comma separated list of algorithms for which to generate hashes. See ALGORITHMS below.

  -b, --batch
     Use batch mode; i.e., get the input from the command line rather than prompting for it. This option should be used with extreme care, since if the input is a password, it will be clearly visible on the command line.

  -d, --duplicate-hashes
     Allow duplicate hashes; i.e. if the same algorithm is available from multiple implementation sources, generate a hash for each implementation

  -e, --echo
     Enable Echo mode; i.e. when the user is prompted for input, the characters she types are echoed on the screen

  -f FILE, --file FILE
     Read the input from FILE

  -l, --list
     List supported algorithms, which ones are available, and which implementation sources exist for them

  -h, --help
     Show a short usage summary.       

ALGORITHMS
  mkroesti defines the following keywords to identify distinct hash algorithms:

  base64
  adler32
  crc32
  crc32b
  crypt-system      local crypt()
  crypt-md5         md5-based crypt (hash starts with $1$)
  crypt-apr1        md5-based crypt, Apache variant (hash starts with $apr1$)
  crypt-blowfish    blowfish-based crypt (hash starts with $2a$)
  md2
  md4
  md5
  sha-0             original, superseded by sha-1

  ripemd            original, superseded by ripemd-160
  ripemd-128
  ripemd-160
  ripemd-256
  ripemd-320
  haval-128-[345]   3, 4 or 5 rounds
  haval-160-[345]
  haval-192-[345]
  haval-224-[345]
  haval-256-[345]
  whirlpool
  tiger-128
  tiger-160
  tiger-192
  tiger2
  snefru
  gost
  windows-lm
  windows-nt
  mysql-password    MySQL's PASSWORD() function

  mkroesti defines the following aliases to refer to sets of hash algorithms

  all
  chksum
  crypt
  sha
  ripemd
  haval
  tiger
  snefru

EXAMPLES

  (1) Prompt the user to interactively provide the input, not echoing the input on the screen. Hashes for all algorithms are generated.

    mkroesti 

  (2) Take the input from file foo and generate hashes for the algorithms md5, sha-1 and haval-128 (4 rounds variant)

    mkroesti -f foo -a md5,sha-1,haval-128-4

  (3) Take the input from standard input and generate a single hash using the local crypt() system function

    cat foo | mkroesti -a crypt-system

  (4) Use the string "secret" as input and generate hashes for all algorithms of the SHA and RIPEMD family.

    mkroesti -b -a sha,ripemd secret

EXIT CODES

  0  success
  1  runtime error
  2  error during parsing of command line arguments

BUGS

  mkroesti is not good at handling large files, because it tries to read its entire input into memory.

  mkroesti does nothing at all about string encodings; if in doubt assume the worst.

  If you find any other bugs, please report them to <mkroesti@herzbube.ch>.

DEPENDENCIES

  mkroesti depends on the following Python modules:

    base64
    hashlib
    crypt
    random
    string
    smbpasswd (see http://barryp.org/software/py-smbpasswd/)
    mhash (see http://labix.org/python-mhash)

TODO
----
* TODOs in the code
* try to improve handling of large inputs
* find out why adler32 and crc32 checksums (provided by zlib module) are not correct

  * see issue 1202: http://bugs.python.org/issue1202
    * as per standard, the result should always be an unsigned number
    * python 2.x implementation always returns a signed number

  * hashemall.com has "3 passes" and "4 passes" variants of tiger-128/160/192; mkroesti currently provides the "3 passes" variant only
* add test suite

Research
--------
* the Python Standard Library
  * provides a couple of modules under the heading "Cryptographic Services" [1]
    * from these I use only the "hashlib" module because it provides all the algorithms of the other modules, and more
      * always present in hashlib: md5, sha-1, sha-224, sha-256, sha-384, sha-512
      * presence of the following depends on the version of the underlying OpenSSL: ripemd-160, sha-0, md2, md4
  * provides a couple of encoding modules
    * "base64" module: provides base64
  * provides the "crypt" module with access to the system's crypt() function
* the module "smbpasswd" [2]; Debian package "python-smbpasswd"; the module provides these algorithms
  * windows-lm, windows-nt
* the module "m2crypto" (MeTooCrypto) [3]; Debian package "python-m2crypto"; is a wrapper for OpenSSL
  * investigate
* the module "mhash" [4]; manually built package "python-mhash"; is a wrapper for the mhash library
  * how to get the python module
    * download
    * unpack tar ball
    * install dependencies (python-dev, libmhash-dev)
    * ./setup.py build
    * ./setup.py install
  * the library/python module provides the following algorithms
    * haval-128, haval-160, haval-192, haval-224, haval-256 (3 rounds variant)

    * whirlpool
    * snefru-128, snefru-256
    * gost
* the module "mcrypt" [5]; manually built package "python-mcrypt"; is a wrapper for the mcrypt library
  * how to get the python module
    * download
    * unpack tar ball
    * install dependencies (python-dev, libmcrypt-dev)
    * ./setup.py build
    * ./setup.py install
  * what does the library/python module provide?
* the module "bcrypt" [5]; Debian package "python-bcrypt"; the module provides this algorithm
  * crypt-blowfish
* details about the Apache-specific md5 algorithm can be found here [7]; the page mentions that OpenSSL knows the algorithm, therefore I try to use a python wrapper for OpenSSL to get at the algorithm

Design
------
* Algorithms
  * Attributes
    * name
    * provider
  * Operations
    * get name
    * get provider
    * hash a given input and return the result as a string; the string's form depends on what is usually expected from the algorithm (e.g. hex digest, signed number, prefixed hash, etc.)
  * Instances
    * are created by mkroesti.factory.AlgorithmFactory, which delegates creation to the appropriate provider
    * must implement mkroesti.algorithm.AlgorithmInterface
* Providers
  * Attributes
    * names of provided algorithms; names must be unique, i.e. a single provider can provide only uniquely named algorithms
    * names of provided aliases; names must be unique, i.e. a single provider can provide only uniquely named aliases
    * mapping of algorithm names and descriptions of implementation sources of these algorithms
    * mapping of algorithm names and aliases that the algorithm names belong to
  * Operations
    * get names of provided algorithms
    * is an algorithm with a given name provided?
    * is an algorithm with a given name available?
    * return string description of the implementation source for an algorithm with a given name (e.g. "Python Standard Library module hashlib")
    * create and return algorithm object for a given algorithm name
    * get names of provided aliases
    * get names of algorithms that a given alias resolves to
  * Instances
    * are usually created right after the class declaration; each provider class should be instantiated exactly once
    * must implement mkroesti.provider.ProviderInterface
    * must register with mkroesti.registry.ProviderRegistry; this can be accomplished by subclassing mkroesti.provider.ProviderBase (which in turn subclasses mkroesti.provider.ProviderInterface)
* Registry
  * Attributes
    * list of providers
  * Operations
    * register provider
    * does an algorithm with a given name exist?
    * is an algorithm with a given name available?
    * return the providers that the algorithm with a given name is available from
    * does an alias with a given name exist?
    * return the names of algorithms that a given alias resolves to
  * Instances
    * there is exactly one instance
    * implements the Singleton design pattern
* Factory
  * Attributes
    * should all available algorithm objects be created for a given algorithm name, or only one?
  * Operations
    * create and return list of algorithm objects for a given alias or algorithm name
  * Instances
    * there is exactly one instance
    * implements the Singleton design pattern
  * Handling of aliases
    * when a create request comes in, it must first be established whether the given name is an alias or an algorithm name
    * to this end, the factory assumes that the name is an alias and tries to resolve the alias using mkroesti.registry.ProviderRegistry
    * if resolution is successful, create requests are spawned in a recursive manner for each of the names obtained by alias resolution
    * if resolution is not successful, the create request proceeds as normal
