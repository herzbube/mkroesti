This directory contains data that can be used to perform end-to-end tests on
mkroesti.

The files in the folder "input" are used as input to mkroesti. Unless noted
otherwise at the end of this document, each file contains UTF-8 encoded data.

The files in the folder "result" contain the expected hash values.

Each file in the folder "input" has a corresponding file of the same name in
the folder "result". Each file name in both the "input" and "result" folder
must correspond to the name of an algorithm.

The special file "EXCLUDE" contains names of algorithms that should be
excluded from the end-to-end test. The format of the file is this:
- lines starting with # are treated as comments and are ignored
- empty lines, or lines that contain only whitespace, are ignored
- all other lines are treated as an algorithm lines
- an algorithm line contains exactly one algorithm name
- whitespace at the beginning and end of an algorithm line is ignored

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The expected hash values have been double-checked for correctness with the
following online hashing services:
- http://hashkiller.com
- http://www.hashemall.com/

In addition, values for the adler32, crc32 and crc32b algorithms have been
double-checked with the cli version of PHP 5.2.11. Earlier versions of PHP
have had bugs reported against them in regard to these algorithms. Example:

UTF-8 encoded text data.
