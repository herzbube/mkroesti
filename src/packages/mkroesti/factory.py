class AlgorithmFactory:
    """Factory that creates algorithm objects.

    Algorithm objects are instances of classes that implement
    mkroesti.algorithm.AlgorithmInterface (they do not necessarily inherit
    from that class).

    AlgorithmFactory is mostly a convenience class that acts as a friendly
    front-end to the mkroesti.registry.ProviderRegistry singleton. Clients
    who simply want to go straight ahead and do some hashing can call
    createAlgorithms(), which will return a list of algorithm objects. The
    list can then be iterated and one hash for each of the algorithm objects
    can be created.

    If a client specifies an alias instead of a real algorithm name,
    createAlgorithms() transparently resolves the alias to its real
    algorithm names. This is the main reason why the function returns a
    list instead of just a single algorithm object.

    If several providers exist for the same algorithm name, createAlgorithms()
    by default selects one of them (there is no guarantee which one) and creates
    only one algorithm object, using the selected provider. Clients, however,
    may override this behaviour and request that they want all algorithm
    objects. This is the second reason why createAlgorithms() returns a list
    instead of just a single algorithm object.

        for those algorithms that are actually available.
        
        If the given name refers to a known algorithm, but the algorithm is
        not available, an UnavailableAlgorithmError is raised.

        If the given name neither refers to a known alias, nor to a known
