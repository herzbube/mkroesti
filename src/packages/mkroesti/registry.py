class ProviderRegistry:
    """Registry where provider objects must be registered.

    Provider objects are instances of classes that implement
    mkroesti.provider.ProviderInterface (they do not need to inherit from it).

    Provider objects that want to contribute algorithms to mkroesti's operation
    must be registered by calling addProvider(). ProviderRegistry offers a
    number of useful queries that allow clients to inspect which algorithms
    exist (getAlgorithmNames()) and which algorithms are actually available
    (getAvailableAlgorithmNames()). The difference is that sometimes a provider
    knows how to provide a certain algorithm "in theory", but is unable to
    do so in the current environment, e.g. because some third party modules are
    missing.

    To actually obtain an algorithm object, a client must first call
    getProviders() to retrieve a list of providers that the algorithm is known
    to. Next the client must check each provider whether the algorithm is
    actually available from it; from among these providers, the client must now
    select one and instruct it to create the algorithm object. Note: The client
    should use the interface defined by AlgorithmInterface to interact with the
    algorithm object (the algorithm object's class does not necessarily
    inherit from AlgorithmInterface).

    ProviderRegistry also supports the handling of aliases. Clients may inspect
    which aliases exist (getAliasNames()) and resolve aliases to real algorithm
    names (resolveAlias()). 

    ProviderRegistry is a singleton. The singleton accessor (and creator)
    is ProviderRegistry.getInstance().
